            // "That computer ran Intcode programs like the gravity assist program it was working on; surely there are enough spare parts up there to build a new Intcode computer!"

            // An Intcode program is a list of integers separated by commas(like 1, 0, 0, 3, 99).
            // To run one, start by looking at the first integer (called position 0). 
            // Here, you will find an opcode - either 1, 2, or 99.
            // The opcode indicates what to do; for example, 
            // 99 means that the program is finished and should immediately halt.Encountering an unknown opcode means something went wrong.

            //  Opcode 1 adds together numbers read from two positions and stores the result in a third position.
            // The three integers immediately after the opcode tell you these three positions - 
            // the first two indicate the positions from which you should read the input values, and the third indicates the position at which the output should be stored.

            // For example, if your Intcode computer encounters 1,10,20,30, it should read the values at positions 10 and 20, 
            // add those values, and then overwrite the value at position 30 with their sum.

            // Opcode 2 works exactly like opcode 1, except it multiplies the two inputs instead of adding them. 
            // Again, the three integers after the opcode indicate where the inputs and outputs are, not their values.

            // Once you're done processing an opcode, move to the next one by stepping forward 4 positions.

            // For example, suppose you have the following program:

            //            1,9,10,3,2,3,11,0,99,30,40,50

            //  For the purposes of illustration, here is the same program split into multiple lines:

            // 1,9,10,3,
            // 2,3,11,0,
            // 99,
            // 30,40,50

            //The first four integers, 1,9,10,3, are at positions 0, 1, 2, and 3.Together, they represent the first opcode(1, addition), 
            // the positions of the two inputs(9 and 10), and the position of the output(3). 
            // To handle this opcode, you first need to get the values at the input positions: position 9 contains 30, 
            // and position 10 contains 40. Add these numbers together to get 70. 
            // Then, store this value at the output position; here, the output position(3) is at position 3, so it overwrites itself. Afterward, the program looks like this:

            // 1,9,10,70,
            // 2,3,11,0,
            // 99,
            // 30,40,50

            // Step forward 4 positions to reach the next opcode, 2.
            // This opcode works just like the previous, but it multiplies instead of adding.
            //  The inputs are at positions 3 and 11; these positions contain 70 and 50 respectively.Multiplying these produces 3500; this is stored at position 0:

            //3500,9,10,70,
            //2,3,11,0,
            //99,
            //30,40,50

            //Stepping forward 4 more positions arrives at opcode 99, halting the program.

            //Here are the initial and final states of a few more small programs:

            //            1,0,0,0,99 becomes 2,0,0,0,99(1 + 1 = 2).
            //    2,3,0,3,99 becomes 2,3,0,6,99(3 * 2 = 6).
            //    2,4,4,5,99,0 becomes 2,4,4,5,99,9801(99 * 99 = 9801).
            //    1,1,1,4,99,5,6,0,99 becomes 30,1,1,4,2,5,6,0,99.

            // First, you'll need to add two new instructions:

            // Opcode 3 takes a single integer as input and saves it to the address given by its only parameter.
            // For example, the instruction 3,50 would take an input value and store it at address 50.
            // Opcode 4 outputs the value of its only parameter.
            // For example, the instruction 4,50 would output the value at address 50.

            // Programs that use these instructions will come with documentation that explains what should be connected to the input and output. The program 3,0,4,0,99 outputs whatever it gets as input, then halts.

            // Second, you'll need to add support for parameter modes:

            // Each parameter of an instruction is handled based on its parameter mode. 
            // Right now, your ship computer already understands parameter mode 0, position mode, 
            // which causes the parameter to be interpreted as a position - if the parameter is 50, 
            // its value is the value stored at address 50 in memory.Until now, all parameters have been in position mode.

            // Now, your ship computer will also need to handle parameters in mode 1, 
            // immediate mode. In immediate mode, a parameter is interpreted as a value - if the parameter is 50, its value is simply 50.

            // Parameter modes are stored in the same value as the instruction's opcode. 
            // The opcode is a two-digit number based only on the ones and tens digit of the value, that is, 
            // the opcode is the rightmost two digits of the first value in an instruction. 
            // Parameter modes are single digits, one per parameter, 
            // read right-to-left from the opcode: the first parameter's mode is in the hundreds digit, 
            // the second parameter's mode is in the thousands digit, the third parameter's mode is in the ten-thousands digit, and so on.
            // Any missing modes are 0.

            // For example, consider the program 1002,4,3,4,33.

            // The first instruction, 1002,4,3,4, is a multiply instruction - the rightmost two digits of the first value, 02, 
            // indicate opcode 2, multiplication.
            // Then, going right to left, the parameter modes are 0(hundreds digit), 1(thousands digit), 
            // and 0(ten - thousands digit, not present and therefore zero):

            //ABCDE
            // 1002

            //DE - two - digit opcode,      02 == opcode 2
            // C - mode of 1st parameter,  0 == position mode
            // B - mode of 2nd parameter,  1 == immediate mode
            // A - mode of 3rd parameter,  0 == position mode,
            //                                  omitted due to being a leading zero

            // This instruction multiplies its first two parameters. 
            // The first parameter, 4 in position mode, works like it did before - 
            // its value is the value stored at address 4(33).The second parameter, 
            // 3 in immediate mode, simply has value 3.The result of this operation, 33 * 3 = 99, 
            // is written according to the third parameter, 4 in position mode, which also works like it did before -99 is written to address 4.

            // Parameters that an instruction writes to will never be in immediate mode.

            // Finally, some notes:

            // It is important to remember that the instruction pointer should increase by the number of values in
            // the instruction after the instruction finishes. Because of the new instructions, this amount is no longer always 4.
            // Integers can be negative: 1101,100,-1,4,0 is a valid program(find 100 + -1, store the result in position 4).

            // The TEST diagnostic program will start by requesting from the user the ID of the system to
            // test by running an input instruction - provide it 1, the ID for the ship's air conditioner unit.

            // It will then perform a series of diagnostic tests confirming that various parts of the Intcode computer, 
            // like parameter modes, function correctly.For each test, it will run an output instruction indicating 
            // how far the result of the test was from the expected value, where 0 means the test was successful.
            // Non - zero outputs mean that a function is not working correctly; 
            // check the instructions that were run before the output instruction to see which one failed.

            // Finally, the program will output a diagnostic code and immediately halt. 
            // This final output isn't an error; an output followed immediately by a halt 
            // means the program finished. If all outputs were zero except the diagnostic code, the diagnostic program ran successfully.

            // In order to lock on to the signal, you'll need to boost your sensors. The Elves send up the latest BOOST program - Basic Operation Of System Test.

            // While BOOST(your puzzle input) is capable of boosting your sensors, for tenuous safety reasons, 
            // it refuses to do so until the computer it runs on passes some checks to demonstrate it is a complete Intcode computer.

            // Your existing Intcode computer is missing one key feature: it needs support for parameters in relative mode.

            // Parameters in mode 2, relative mode, behave very similarly to parameters in position mode: 
            // the parameter is interpreted as a position. Like position mode, parameters in relative mode can be read from or written to.

            // The important difference is that relative mode parameters don't count from address 0. 
            // Instead, they count from a value called the relative base. The relative base starts at 0.

            // The address a relative mode parameter refers to is itself plus the current relative base.
            // When the relative base is 0, relative mode parameters and position mode parameters with the same value refer to the same address.

            // For example, given a relative base of 50, a relative mode parameter of - 7 refers to memory address 50 + -7 = 43.

            // The relative base is modified with the relative base offset instruction:

            // Opcode 9 adjusts the relative base by the value of its only parameter.
            // The relative base increases(or decreases, if the value is negative) by the value of the parameter.

            // For example, if the relative base is 2000, then after the instruction 109,19, 
            // the relative base would be 2019.If the next instruction were 204,-34, then the value at address 1985 would be output.

            // Your Intcode computer will also need a few other capabilities:

            // The computer's available memory should be much larger than the initial program.
            // Memory beyond the initial program starts with the value 0 and can be read or written like any other memory.
            // (It is invalid to try to access memory at a negative address, though.)
            // The computer should have support for large numbers. Some instructions near the beginning of the BOOST program will verify this capability.

            // Here are some example programs that use these features:

            // 109, 1, 204, -1, 1001, 100, 1, 100, 1008, 100, 16, 101, 1006, 101, 0, 99 takes no input and produces a copy of itself as output.
            // 1102, 34915192, 34915192, 7, 4, 7, 99, 0 should output a 16 - digit number.
            // 104, 1125899906842624, 99 should output the large number in the middle.

            // The BOOST program will ask for a single input; 
            // run it in test mode by providing it the value 1.
            // It will perform a series of checks on each opcode, 
            // output any opcodes(and the associated parameter modes) that seem to be functioning incorrectly, 
            // and finally output a BOOST keycode.

            // Once your Intcode computer is fully functional, 
            // the BOOST program should report no malfunctioning opcodes when run in test mode;

(30 A is produced because its reaction requires that it is created in increments of 10.)
